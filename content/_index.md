hoping this will finally be a space (I can be satisfied with) to jot down ideas 
or technical learnings from work, books, and life

the plan is to have:
- Stickies: an (almost) endless scrolling of short posts I've made - kind of like a scroll of sticky notes
- Blog: Proper posts, sorted by date and index page shows you all the posts in order by title (no preview)
- Search: Hugo already has inbuilt search but I'd like to edit it if necessary
