__Made (Love) in Singapore__
I asked if you were DTF but
you said you only like their fried rice.
So bobian, go down buy, pay full price.
Then go down—on you—your Bukit Bat-
ok in my face. Now something stands, jut
out like Milo tower, slowly rise
like GST. You kiss me. I taste spice.
We get in position… then kena “What

are you doing here?” by NParks staff.
_Staircase too cram. Handicap toilet close_
_liao_. “Go home lah!” _My sister sleeps in_
_the same room as me—how can?_ It’s tough—
love—but here, finding space for fourth base
is harder than trying not to complain.
