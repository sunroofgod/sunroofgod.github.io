{{< poem >}}
__I eat love for a living__
I burp out different-sized chunks of
half-digested love from the night 
before. It tastes like pineapple 
shots with regret chasers. All I 
remember is over-stuffing my 
body with an abundance of 
uncooked proportions of 
all-you-can-eat all-batter 
no-meat meatloaf and 	
the relief from the 
loss of hunger 
that came 
after.
